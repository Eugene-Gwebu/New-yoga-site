# Yoga Domain 

Yoga Domain is a website that provides online videos with instructions to help users do yoga and meditation 
from the comfort of their own home. As the tagline on the home page says, it's "your one-stop shop for yoga and 
meditation at home". 

On the Website, users will be able to watch videos that they can follow along to. This content is accessible from 
anywhere in the world, and users can participate in their own time. However, they can also participate in group 
activities online such as meditation and yoga classes with a private instrustor. Users can take part in a group
with other people, or by themselves with their own instructor depending on which subscription bundle they choose.
