# Yoga Domain 

Yoga Domain is a website that provides online videos with instructions to help users do yoga and meditation 
from the comfort of their own home. As the tagline on the home page says, it's "your one-stop shop for yoga and 
meditation at home". 
![](

On the Website, users will be able to watch videos that they can follow along to. This content is accessible from 
anywhere in the world, and users can participate in their own time. However, they can also participate in group 
activities online such as meditation and yoga classes with a private instrustor. Users can take part in a group
with other people, or by themselves with their own instructor depending on which subscription bundle they choose. 

## Features 

* ### Navigation 
* The navigation bar located at the top of the page has the website logo "YOGA DOMAIN" on the left.
* This logo is also a link that sends the user to the home page when it is clicked. 
* On the right side of the navigation bar is the menu. Within it there are clickable links titled: HOME, MISSION, CLASSES, CONTACT, SUBSCRIBE.
* Each link also has an aria-label in order to be accessible for visually impaired users.
* The font used here and throughout the website is called "JOST". It was chosen because it is spacious and bold, which felt synonymous with yoga and meditation as they are about breathing and streatching.

* ### Unsolved Bugs 
* The navigation bar has a small mark in the middle that seems to be part of the <nav> element that turns the logo into a clickable link.
* I was not able to fix the error from the html testing. The charset element is an important part of the html fil and I could not determine
  why the testing flagged it as an error. 

## Deployment 
  
* I managed to deploy the website on github through the github pages section.
* I chose to deploy the site through the main branch.
