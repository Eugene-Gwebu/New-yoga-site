# Yoga Domain 

Yoga Domain is a website that provides online videos with instructions to help users do yoga and meditation 
from the comfort of their own home. As the tagline on the home page says, it's "your one-stop shop for yoga and 
meditation at home". 

On the Website, users will be able to watch videos that they can follow along to. This content is accessible from 
anywhere in the world, and users can participate in their own time. However, they can also participate in group 
activities online such as meditation and yoga classes with a private instrustor. Users can take part in a group
with other people, or by themselves with their own instructor depending on which subscription bundle they choose. 

## Features 

* ### Navigation 
* The navigation bar located at the top of the page has the website logo "YOGA DOMAIN" on the left.
* This logo is also a link that sends the user to the home page when it is clicked. 
* On the right side of the navigation bar is the menu. Within it there are clickable links titled: HOME, MISSION, CLASSES, CONTACT, SUBSCRIBE.
* Each link also has an aria-label in order to be accessible for visually impaired users.
* The font used here and throughout the website is called "JOST". It was chosen because it is spacious and bold, which felt synonymous with yoga and meditation as they are about breathing and streatching.  

## The Header 

* ### The Home Page 
* This page is very simple as it showes an image that spans the width of the screen. 
* The image is a woman meditating with her back toward the user as she stair at a large and expansive landscape.
* the landscape gives the feeling of entering a large space that gives the user room to breathe and expand (or stretch) with no limits, much like the font. 

## The Mission 

* ### Our Mission 
* The mission section of the page gives two brief sentences which highlight the reson for the website's existance, and how it can be benificial for users to join and participate. 
* This statement is seen on the left side of the section, on the right side is an image to accompany and compliment the mission statement. 
* The photo on the right is a woman who is meditating peacefully and is visibly happy doing so in the comfort of her own home.
